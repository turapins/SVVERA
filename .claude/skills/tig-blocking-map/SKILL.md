description: Tigran's project-agnostic method for giving Seedance / Higgsfield character DISPOSITION via a color-coded outline schematic — a "staging reference" (blocking map). Use WHENEVER a user attaches a frame/still and asks for a blocking map / staging reference, whenever a video prompt needs precise multi-character staging (who is where, facing which way), whenever characters jump seats or swap places between shot sizes, or on the words "blocking map," "staging reference," "diagram," "@staging_," "@map_," "position map." Figures are ALWAYS bound to letters A, B, C, D... in PROMPT TEXT ONLY — no letters are drawn on the map. The map is GEOMETRY ONLY — it must never bleed style, colors, wardrobe, or location into the shot.

# TIG BLOCKING MAP v2 — staging reference as character disposition (any project)

A **staging reference** is a deliberately schematic, color-coded OUTLINE drawing fed to the video model alongside the real location and character references. It tells the model WHO IS WHERE — nothing else. It is built to carry maximum geometry with minimum style mass, because style bleed from the map into the shot is the method's known enemy.

## THE THREE-LAYER ANTI-BLEED ARCHITECTURE (why v2 looks like this)

Bleed has three feeds; v2 closes all three:

1. **IMAGE**: figures are thin muted-color OUTLINES, no fills, no color blocks. Line-work reads as "plan"; big flat color fields read as "aesthetic." The grid is faint — it is an authoring tool (see TRAJECTORIES), not a signal to the model.
2. **TEXT**: the connector block is written in POSITIVE form. Models are weak at negation — "no flat illustration, no vector shapes, no grid" still injects the tokens *flat, vector, grid* into the video prompt and primes the very style being banned. The connector therefore never names the map's graphic style at all; it only asserts where style DOES come from (the location and character references). Graphic vocabulary exists in exactly one place: the diagram GENERATION prompt, which never touches the video context.
3. **STRUCTURE**: the staging reference is attached LAST, after the location and character references, so the photo references dominate the style vote.

## THE WORKFLOW — two steps, in order

**STEP 1 — the user uploads a frame → deliver the diagram prompt.**
The source image IS attached to the diagram generation (as `image_1`) — it guarantees the exact scene match — but it must be SCOPED: the prompt opens with a guard declaring the image is a COMPOSITION-ONLY guide (framing, angle, crop, positions, poses, scale), that its photographic look must NOT be copied, that NOTHING may be added that is not in the image, and that CROPPED BODIES MUST NOT BE COMPLETED (if a figure's head is cut by the frame edge, the drawing cuts it too). The assistant still translates every character's position, pose, facing direction and anchoring geometry into explicit text — the words carry the staging, the image pins the outline. Deliver, always together:
1. The **diagram-generation prompt** (template below).
2. The **`@staging_` tag to assign to the RESULT** once generated (e.g. `@staging_[PROJECT]_[scene]_[version]`), plus the **`@loc_` tag** for the source image in the format `@loc_[PROJECT]_[name]_[scene]_[version]` (e.g. `@loc_TROY_battlefield_s07_v1`) — scene and version in the tag keep multiple frames and retakes of the same location from colliding.
3. A **one-line color key** describing what each color is in the source frame (e.g. "BLUE = the captive soldier, center-foreground").
Do NOT move to step 2 until asked — diagram first.

**STEP 2 — when asked, deliver the connector block** (template below), where the user binds each letter to THEIR character tag. Letters exist ONLY in the prompt text; the map carries only colors.

## STEP 1 TEMPLATE — the diagram prompt (use exactly, fill the brackets)

```
@[Image 1](image_1) — use the attached image ONLY as the compositional guide: copy its exact framing, camera angle, crop, and the positions, poses and scale of every person — but do NOT copy its photographic look: no photo textures, no realistic lighting, no realistic faces, no colors from the image. Do NOT add anything that is not in the attached image. Do NOT complete cropped bodies — if a body part is cut off by the frame edge in the image, cut it off in the drawing. The OUTPUT is a flat schematic:
Flat minimalist technical LINE DRAWING, a staging plan for a film scene — an obviously schematic, non-photographic drawing on a white background with a very faint, thin, light-grey graph-paper grid. Figures are drawn as clean THIN OUTLINES in muted colors — NO fills, NO solid color blocks, NO shading, NO texture, NO realism, NO text, NO letters, NO labels anywhere.
Front view matching the attached image's framing exactly: [N] outline figures.
[For each figure: POSITION IN FRAME — a MUTED-COLOR outline figure, what is visible (full body / head and shoulders only / torso and arms only), pose exactly as in the image (seated / standing / head tilted back / mouth open / back to camera), facing direction, any signature prop as a simple outlined shape and exactly where it sits relative to the body.]
[Anchoring furniture/architecture as simple thin-outline shapes and where — or "no furniture, open background."]
[Background extras, if any, as tiny faint grey silhouettes, exact area of frame — or omit.]
Nothing else — no ground line, no extra props, no extra figures. Simple, readable, diagrammatic — flat 2D line drawing, minimal detail, only who is where. --ar [match source frame] --style raw --stylize 30 --v 8.1 --no photorealism, photo texture, realistic lighting, realistic faces, shading, solid color fills, color blocks, text, letters, labels, typography
```

Template notes:
- Muted color palette for outlines: muted blue, muted orange, muted yellow, muted purple, muted red, muted green — one per figure, maximally distinct hues, identity only.
- The frame-mismatch traps to check EVERY time before delivering: (a) bodies cropped by the frame edge must be described as cropped AND forbidden from completion; (b) head angle / gaze direction spelled out ("tilted far back, face angled up"); (c) prop height pinned relative to anatomy ("across the throat, under the chin — not the chest"); (d) anything the assistant is tempted to add that is not in the frame — don't.
- The `@staging_` tag is NOT inside this prompt; it is assigned to the generated drawing afterward. In VIDEO prompts, reference ONLY the staging drawing (`@staging_...`) — never the source photo as a composition image.

## STEP 2 TEMPLATE — the connector block (paste into the video prompt's references)

POSITIVE FORM ONLY. Never name the map's graphic style in the video prompt — no "flat," "vector," "schematic," "grid," "color blocks," "diagram," "illustration," not even as negations.

ONE PASTE: the connector is self-contained — the LOCKS paragraph is its final section, so the user pastes a single block into the video prompt's references and never hunts for a second insertion point.

```
@staging_[PROJECT]_[scene]_[version] — POSITION REFERENCE ONLY
Use this reference solely to read where each figure is placed, its pose, and its facing direction inside @loc_[PROJECT]_[name]_[scene]_[version]. Every visual quality of the shot — style, light, color grade, faces, wardrobe, environment, props — comes exclusively from @loc_[PROJECT]_[name]_[scene]_[version] and the character references. The shot is a fully photoreal live-action frame.

LETTER LEGEND (letters exist only in this prompt; they do not appear on the reference)
@A = the BLUE figure on the staging reference = [your character reference/tag] → [position: spot, pose, facing].
@B = the ORANGE figure on the staging reference = [your character reference/tag] → [position].
[...one line per figure...]

RENDER RULE: place the real, photoreal characters (from their own references) into the real location @loc_[PROJECT]_[name]_[scene]_[version] at the positions this reference defines, and take nothing else from it.

LOCKS: All style, light, and texture come exclusively from @loc_[PROJECT]_[name]_[scene]_[version] and the character references; @staging_[PROJECT]_[scene]_[version] defines positions only. The colors on the staging reference identify WHO IS WHO on that reference only — wardrobe and grading come from the character and location references. Everyone stays in their staging-locked position until their scripted action.
```

ATTACHMENT ORDER: location reference and character references FIRST, staging reference LAST.

## TAG NAMING

- Format: `@loc_[PROJECT]_[name]_[scene]_[version]` and `@staging_[PROJECT]_[scene]_[version]` (e.g. `@loc_ONERIC_TROYbattlefield_s01_v1`, `@staging_ONERIC_TROYhostage_v1`).
- `[PROJECT]` is always ALL CAPS (ONERIC). A sub-world prefix inside a name keeps its caps (TROYbattlefield = the Troy sub-world's battlefield inside project Oneric).
- Pair the staging name with its location name visibly (TROYbattlefield ↔ TROYhostage) so any tag instantly reads as belonging together.
- Bump `_v2`, `_v3` on every retake; reference only the active version per shot. Tags are arbitrary strings — mixed case is safe; consistency is the only rule.

## RULES

- **Letters live in prompt-space, colors live in image-space.** The map carries only colored outline figures — no letters, no labels, no typography (text rendering is unreliable and a rendered letter can bleed into the shot). Letters A, B, C... exist only in the connector text, bound to figures through color ("@A = the BLUE figure"). This keeps letters' full value — stable non-visual handles usable throughout the video prompt ("@A jerks his head") — with zero render risk.
- **One muted, maximally distinct color per figure.** Color = identity of the letter only, never wardrobe. Outlines, never fills.
- **Front view from the CAMERA's side**, never top-down — video models think in frames, not floor plans.
- **Pose is geometry**: include unusual poses exactly (perched, upside-down, back to camera, head tilted back, head in hand). Include CROP as geometry too: a figure cut by the frame edge is drawn cut.
- **The grid is for the AUTHOR, not the model.** Keep it very faint. It exists so trajectories and paths can be designed with real coordinates (see EXTENSIONS); the model reads drawn paths, not grid cells. Never mention the grid in the connector.
- **Never trade signal for stealth.** A near-invisible map (ultra-faint lines everywhere) removes bleed AND blocking — the model reads geometry through the same pixels that could bleed. Reduce style mass (outlines, muted color, faint grid), never signal contrast.
- Small drawing inaccuracies in the generated map are OK — the legend text overrides them.
- Tags delivered with every step-1 result: `@staging_[PROJECT]_[scene]_[version]` (for the drawing) and `@loc_[PROJECT]_[name]_[scene]_[version]` (for the source frame). Bump the version suffix on every retake; reference only the active version per shot.

## KNOWN FAILURES

- **Style bleed (map look enters the shot)**: caused by any of the three feeds — color-block fills in the map, graphic vocabulary in the video prompt (even as negations — negation blindness), or the map attached before/instead of strong photo references. Fix at all three layers; see ANTI-BLEED ARCHITECTURE. If bleed persists in a moving-character shot, keep movement language plain and physical ("real, live-action gestures"), never "come alive"; last resort, drop the map from that shot.
- **Color → wardrobe bleed** (blue figure → blue tunic): killed by outline-not-fill figures, muted palette, the legend routing identity to the user's character tag (whose own reference controls wardrobe), and the positive locks line routing wardrobe to the character references.
- **Model invents what isn't in the frame** (completes a cropped body, adds a helmet to a headless torso, adds furniture): killed by the guard lines "do NOT add anything that is not in the attached image" + "do NOT complete cropped bodies," by describing crops explicitly per figure, and by putting the invented item in the `--no` list once it has appeared in a failed generation.
- **Prop at wrong height/place** (sword drifts from throat to chest): pin props to anatomy with a positive AND a contrast ("across the THROAT, under the chin — not the chest").
- **Stale staging tags**: multiple maps per scene are fine (versioned `@staging_..._v2`, `_v3`), but reference only the active version per shot — stale tags cause ghost blocking.

## QA CHECKLIST (run on every test)

On the generated DIAGRAM, before assigning the `@staging_` tag:
1. Thin outlines only — no solid fills, no color blocks, no shading.
2. No text, letters, or labels anywhere on the drawing.
3. Cropped bodies stay cropped (nothing invented: no added heads, helmets, furniture, extra figures).
4. Props at the exact anatomical height/place the frame shows (throat vs chest matters).
5. Poses match the frame exactly: head angle, gaze direction, mouth, unusual positions.
6. Framing/crop matches the source frame's composition and aspect.

On the VIDEO result, after using the connector:
1. Fully photoreal — no flat/graphic look anywhere in the shot.
2. No white/grid background artifacts, no drawn-line edges.
3. No staging-reference colors in wardrobe, armor, or grade.
4. No letters or typography in the shot.
5. Every character in their map-locked position, facing the mapped direction, until their scripted action.
6. If any check fails: fix at the layer that fed it (image → mute/outline further; text → remove graphic tokens from the video prompt; structure → reattach staging LAST) and bump the version tag.

## EXTENSIONS (same convention)

- **Trajectory maps**: the flight of a bullet, a bird, a thrown object, or any function-driven curve is DESIGNED on the faint grid (real coordinates, parabolas, exported curves) and DELIVERED as a drawn dashed path on the map — one distinct muted color per path. The model reads the drawn path, not the grid. Bind each path in the legend with four facts: START, PATH shape, END, and TRIGGER beat ("dashed RED line = the bullet's path, from B's fist, flat and straight, exiting frame-right, on the gunshot").
- **Camera path maps**: arrows on the drawing for dolly/pan direction — declare "arrows = camera path only" in the legend.
- **Movement maps**: dashed line for a character's cross (A→new mark) — declare start, path, end mark, and WHEN the move happens (tie to a dialogue/action beat).
